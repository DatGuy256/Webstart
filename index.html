        <ol>My Hobbies:</ol>
        <li>Martial Arts</li>
        <li>Reading Books</li>
        <li>Playing Chess</li>
    <p>I started boxing in Greensboro, North Carolina after running into trouble in the 7th grade. When I turned 16 I moved to Charlotte,NC.
            In Charlotte I joined the wrestling team whee I was cut for bad adacademics. I stopped martial arts till I moved to Atlanta, GA and joined <a href=https://mmaatl.com/midtown-location/">Team Octopus.</a>
            This is where I fell in love with Muay Thai. I have always been into philosophy, esoteric, and sci-fi books. Never read a Harry Potter book though.
            I started playing chess when I was fourteen years old in middle school and I joined My high school chess club. Now I just play chess on my phone.</p>
